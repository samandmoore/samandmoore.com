Hi there! This is the personal website of yours truly, Sam Moore.
I am a software engineer living and working in New York City. I
spend my free time reading and contemplating how to be better at
writing software and mentoring other engineers. I have a strange
love for American history, Gnomes, and  the Lord of the Rings.
I enjoy music, particularly classic R&B, Soul, 60s & 70s rock music,
and modern artists influenced by those genres.
