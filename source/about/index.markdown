I'm a quick-witted, aspiring software engineer / web developer from Queens, NY. I am constantly searching for better gadgets, knishes, and programming tools.

I currently work in NYC doing web development. I love to code and I often lose myself in new languages.

I live in Astoria, Queens with my loving girlfriend.

My favorite things to do are read, play video games, and occasionally skateboard.

I strive to keep my life as simple as possible while still experiencing new things everyday.

Feel free to contact me anytime at me at samandmoore dot com.

Or, if you'd prefer, you can catch me anywhere on the wonderful internet as samandmoore.
